# Hey, I'm Vineet 👋

I started out as a full-stack engineer who liked owning the whole flow — backend APIs, frontend interfaces, databases, deployments, and everything in between.  
Over time this pulled me deeper into cloud systems, distributed services, and the kind of architecture work that keeps real products running.

That foundation still drives how I work:  
design the system first, understand the data, make it scalable, then build the parts on top of it.

## What I’m good at

**Full-stack development**  
APIs, authentication, database design, frontend logic, state management, caching, background jobs — I enjoy writing the pieces that connect everything together.

**Cloud & infrastructure**  
Containerized services, CI/CD, AWS basics, logging, monitoring, and the mental model of “how does this behave in production?”  
I love the clarity that good infrastructure brings.

**Building for real users**  
Fast responses, predictable behavior, clean flows, and systems that can grow without turning chaotic.

## What I’m exploring now

**React Native + modern mobile patterns**  
I’m learning how to build mobile apps that feel smooth, responsive, and actually useful day-to-day.  
Think good UI, clean navigation, offline behavior, and talking to smart backends.

**Multi-agent AI systems**  
Not just calling an LLM — coordinating multiple reasoning units that can research, review, summarize, plan, or make decisions together.  
I’m experimenting with agent orchestration, contextual memory, retrieval, and how these agents can power mobile experiences.

**Where mobile meets AI**  
This is the direction I’m most excited about.  
Apps that respond to the world, remember context, and behave more like partners than interfaces.

## How I work

I like systems that make sense.  
I like APIs that don’t surprise you.  
I like UIs that guide instead of confuse.  
And I try to build things that can survive beyond the first version.

If you’re somewhere in the world of full-stack, cloud, mobile, or applied AI and want to build, explore, or break things together, I’m around.
